# Basic-Hanged
Hey! This is the classical Hanged Game with 3 levels of Difficulty.
The objective of the game is to guess the word by inputing letters. 
The game is prepared for terminal. I made it in an hour, so it's probably not bug free.
I would like to let user add words in the future. You will need to use getnum library and random library to run the game.
Any comments please write to my email  mdedeu@itba.edu.ar
