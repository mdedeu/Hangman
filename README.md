# Basic-Hanged
Hey! This is the classical Hanged Game with 3 levels of Difficulty.
The objective of the game is to guess the word by inputing letters. 
The game is prepared for terminal. I made it in an hour, so it's probably not bug free.
I would like to let user add words in the future. For now, you'll just have at your disposal the words that i wrote for testing. You will need to use getnum library and random library to run the game.
Any comments please write to my email  mdedeu@itba.edu.ar
